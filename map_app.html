			<p style="width: 1800px;">History of Bucharest</p>
			
			<p id="first" style="width: 1800px;">Bucharest is the capital and largest city of Romania, as well as its cultural, industrial, and financial centre. 
			It is located in the southeast of the country, at 44°25′57″N 26°06′14″ ECoordinates: 44°25′57″N 26°06′14″E, on the banks of the Dâmbovița River, 
			less than 60 km (37.3 mi) north of the Danube River and the Bulgarian border. Bucharest was first mentioned in documents in 1459. 
			It became the capital of Romania in 1862 and is the centre of Romanian media, culture, and art. Its architecture is a mix of historical (neo-classical), 
			interbellum (Bauhaus and art deco), communist-era and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and 
			the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of "Little Paris" (Micul Paris). Although buildings and districts in 
			the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes, and above all Nicolae Ceaușescu's program of systematization, 
			many survived. In recent years, the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom. In 2016, the historical city centre was listed 
			as "endangered" by the World Monuments Watch.</p>

			<p id="second" style="width: 1800px;">
			According to the 2011 census, 1,883,425 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the 2002 census. Adding the satellite 
			towns around the urban area, the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27 million people. According to Eurostat, 
			Bucharest has a functional urban area of 2,412,530 residents (as of 2015). Bucharest is the seventh-largest city in the European Union by population 
			within city limits, after London, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, Paris and Vienna.
			Economically, Bucharest is the most prosperous city in Romania and is one of the main industrial centres and transportation hubs of Eastern 
			and Central Europe. The city has big convention facilities, educational institutes, cultural venues, traditional "shopping arcades", a
			nd recreational areas.The city proper is administratively known as the "Municipality of Bucharest" (Municipiul București), and has the same 
			administrative level as that of a national county, being further subdivided into six sectors, each governed by a local mayor.

			<p id="third" id="history"; style="width: 1800px;">Bucharest's history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in antiquity 
			until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the "Citadel of București" in 1459, 
			it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler.
			</p>
			
			<hr>

			<p id="fourth" style="width: 1800px;">
			The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by 
			Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest.
			The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established 
			as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase 
			in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire.
			</p>

			<p id="fifth" style="width: 1800px;">
			Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu).
			Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea's plague in 1813–14, the city 
			was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia 
			(three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during 
			the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the 
			city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city.
			In 1862, after Wallachia and Moldavia were united to form the Principality of Romania, Bucharest became the new nation's capital city. In 1881, 
			it became the political centre of the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania under King Carol I. During the second half of the 19th century, 
			the city's population increased dramatically, and a new period of urban development began. During this period, gas lighting, horse-drawn trams, 
			and limited electrification were introduced. The Dâmbovița River was also massively channelled in 1883, thus putting a stop to previously 
			endemic floods like the 1865 flooding of Bucharest. The Fortifications of Bucharest were built. The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan 
			high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of "Little Paris" (Micul Paris) of the east, with Calea Victoriei as its Champs-Élysées.
			Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918, the city was occupied by German forces as a result of the Battle of Bucharest, with the official 
			capital temporarily moved to Iași (also called Jassy), in the Moldavia region. After World War I, Bucharest became the capital of Greater Romania. 
			In the interwar years, Bucharest's urban development continued, with the city gaining an average of 30,000 new residents each year. Also, 
			some of the city's main landmarks were built in this period, including Arcul de Triumf and Palatul Telefoanelor. However, the Great Depression 
			took its toll on Bucharest's citizens, culminating in the Grivița Strike of 1933.

			<p style="width: 1800px;">Bucharest's position</p>
			
			<p id="location"; style="width: 1800px;">
			Bucharest — the capital city of Romania — is located at the same latitude with the cities of Portland - Oregon; Montreal - Canada; 
			Venice - Italy; and Bordeaux - France.
			Bucharest is situated in the southeastern corner of the Romanian Plain, in an area once covered by the 
			Vlăsiei Forest, which after it was cleared, gave way for a fertile flatland. As with many cities, Bucharest is traditionally considered to be 
			built upon seven hills, similar to the seven hills of Rome. Bucharest's seven hills are: Mihai Vodă, Dealul Mitropoliei, Radu Vodă, Cotroceni, 
			Spirei, Văcărești, and Sf. Gheorghe Nou.			
			Bucharest is situated on the banks of the Dâmbovița River, which flows into the Argeș River, a tributary of the Danube. Several lakes – the most 
			important of which are Lake Herăstrău, Lake Floreasca, Lake Tei, and Lake Colentina – stretch across the northern parts of the city, along the 
			Colentina River, a tributary of the Dâmbovița.
